================

This is the Aggregation Module of the library, which contains all aggregation functionalities. In this module, you will find both aggregations and pre-aggregations. Aggregations combine updates from multiple participants aggregating them, while pre-aggregations perform preliminary calculations to reduce the data before the main aggregation, enhancing efficiency and robustness.
