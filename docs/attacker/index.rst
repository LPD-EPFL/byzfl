Attacker
================

This is the Byzantine Attacks Module of the library, which implements various attack strategies against machine learning vectors. In this module, you will find two components: the Attack Implementation module, which details how to execute specific attacks on a vector, and the Attack Optimizer module, which features an algorithm designed to identify the best parameters for an attack based on the given settings.
