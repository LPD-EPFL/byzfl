Pipeline
================

The Pipeline Module integrates the functionalities of the Aggregation and Attacker modules, providing a comprehensive framework for testing aggregations in a systematic and thorough manner. This module allows users to evaluate aggregation strategies easily, simulating scenarios with varying numbers of attackers and different levels of dataset heterogeneity across clients. By leveraging this pipeline, researchers can gain valuable insights into the robustness and effectiveness of their aggregation methods against Byzantine attacks.
